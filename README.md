# Multi-Robot Racing Simulator
This repository offers a multi-robot racing simulation environment built with ROS and Gazebo, designed to serve as a robust testbed for autonomous navigation techniques. 
The environment enables users to deploy and evaluate novel navigation algorithms, particularly those leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), in dynamic racing scenarios. 
With support for multiple robots, this simulator is tailored for research and development in competitive autonomous racing, providing a ready-to-use setup that accelerates 
testing and experimentation.
